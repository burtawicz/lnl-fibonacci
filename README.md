# :question: What is this?
A brief dive into generating the fibonacci sequence in my favourite language, Rust.
The Fibonacci sequence is an infinite sequence of the form `F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)` or in simple terms, each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that proceed it.

# :question: Why does this exist?
Because Lunch and Learns (**LNL**) are great for team building!

# :alembic: Tests
This project has them, and you can run them via `cargo test` at no extra charge!
