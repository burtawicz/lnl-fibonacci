# LNL - The Fibonacci Sequence

:question: What is this?
A brief dive into generating the fibonacci sequence in my favourite language, Rust.

:question: Why?
Because Lunch and Learns (**LNL**) are great for team building!

:alembic: Tests
This project has them, and you can run them via `cargo test` at no extra charge!
